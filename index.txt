Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

 1)HTTP 1.1 is a latest version of hypertext transfer protocol 
2)It was invented in 1997 by web’s chief creator Tim berner lee that includes a committee of INTERNET ENGINEERING TASK FORCE.
3)It provides fastest delivery of web pages and reduce the web traffic
4)It decompresses HTML files, providing a substantial savings in the amount of data to be transmitted.
5)It introduced a KEEP ALIVE MECHANISM (reuse the same TCP connection)
6)HTTP 1.1 does not provide a method for a server to direct clients to discard these cached credentials  which is a big security risk so we jumped into the next version HTTP2.


  HTTP2 is developed by HTTP working group in early 2015 and  approved by          IETF(INTERNET ENGINEERING TASK FORCE)
HTTP2 is binary, instead of textual.
It  is fully multiplexed, instead of ordered and blocked.
HTTP2 allows servers to “push” responses proactively into client caches.
As  of Oct 2021, 47% of the top 10 million websites supported HTTP 2.
